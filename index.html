                             <p>I decided to take this programming course because tech has always been an interest of mine. Ever since I was a little girl, I was alway curious to know what drives thing to function how they do and later when I became an adult I discovered that most of it was in programming. I would also like to increse my chances of getting a better job in future and be a productive memeber of the society and a fulfilled citizen. The idea of solving problems we didn't know we had and making the world a better place also contributed to my interest in programming and it also works as a motivation to become better everyday.</p>
